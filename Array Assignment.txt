Que.1   What is the default value of Array for different data types?
(Answer)   these are the default values of Array for different data types:-
                    
    S. No.	Datatype	               Default Value
     1	           boolean	                         false
     2	            int	                                    0
     3	            double	                         0.0
     4	           String	                         null
     5	         User-Defined Type          null


Que.2   Can you pass the negative number in Array size?
(Answer)     No we cannot  pass the negative number in Array size but if we pass the negative number in an Array  size it wil give the result in compile time error.

Que.3    Where does Array stored in JVM memory?
(Answer)    In Java, arrays are objects, therefore just like other objects arrays are stored in heap area in JVM.

Que.4    What are the disadvantages of Array?
(Answer)     These are the disadvantages of an Array:-

1. The size of an array is fixed. Once the memory is allocated to an array, it cannot be increased or decreased. This prevents us from storing extra data in case we want to. 
2. Allocating less memory than the required to an array leads to loss of data.

3. A single array cannot store values of different data types, i.e, an array is homogenous in nature.
4. The deletion and insertion operations in arrays are very difficult to implement as they store data in contiguous memory locations. To overcome this problem, linked lists are implemented which provide random access of elements.


Que.5   What is an Annonymous Array in java? Give an example.
(Answer)   An array in Java without any name is known as an anonymous array. It is an array just for creating and using instantly. Using an anonymous array, we can pass an array with user values without the referenced variable.

Example:-

// anonymous int array 
new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4};  

// anonymous char array 
new char[] {'x', 'y', 'z'}; 

// anonymous String array
new String[] {"Geeks", "for", "Geeks"}; 

// anonymous multidimensional array
new int[][] { {10, 20}, {30, 40, 50} };

Que.6    What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java?
(Answer)     You can traverse through an array using for loop or forEach loop.

Using the for loop − Instead on printing element by element, you can iterate the index using for loop starting from 0 to length of the array (ArrayName.length) and access elements at each index.

Example
public class IteratingArray {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      //Creating an array
      int myArray[] = new int[7];
      //Populating the array
      myArray[0] = 1254;
      myArray[1] = 1458;
      myArray[2] = 5687;
      myArray[3] = 1457;
      myArray[4] = 4554;
      myArray[5] = 5445;
      myArray[6] = 7524;
      //Printing Contents using for loop
      System.out.println("Contents of the array: ");
      for(int i=0; i<myArray.length; i++) {
         System.out.println(myArray[i]);
      }
   }
}
Output
Contents of the array:
1254
1458
5687
1457
4554
5445
7524
Using the for each loop − Since JDK 1.5, Java introduced a new for loop known as foreach loop or enhanced for loop, which enables you to traverse the complete array sequentially without using an index variable. You can traverse through the array with less effort using this.

Example
import java.util.Arrays;
public class IteratingArray {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      //Creating an array
      int myArray[] = new int[7];
      //Populating the array
      myArray[0] = 1254;
      myArray[1] = 1458;
      myArray[2] = 5687;
      myArray[3] = 1457;
      myArray[4] = 4554;
      myArray[5] = 5445;
      myArray[6] = 7524;
      //Printing Contents using for each loop
      System.out.println("Contents of the array: ");
      for (int element: myArray) {
         System.out.println(element);
      }
   }
}
Output
Contents of the array:
[1254, 1458, 5687, 1457, 4554, 5445, 7524]


Que. 7   What is the difference between length and length() method. Give an example.
(Answer)   Basically the length is a property of array type  class  which is used to find the length or we can say that this property is used to check the elements of array which is stored in it.

Example :-
int a[]={10,20,30};
System.out.println(a.length);        //   output will be   3


And the length() is a method of String class.
Example:- 
String name[]={ "Moon","sun","star"};
System.out.println(name[0].length();           //    output will be 3
