Que.1   What is a Map in Java?
(Answer)  In Java, a Map is a key-value pair based collection that maps keys to values. It is part of the Java Collections Framework and provides a way to store and retrieve elements based on keys rather than indices. The Map interface is designed for fast lookups and associative arrays.

Que.2   What are the commonly used implementations of Map in java?
(Answer)   In Java, several implementations of the Map interface are commonly used, each offering different characteristics in terms of performance, ordering, synchronization, and specific use cases.
 Here are the most commonly used implementations of Map:

HashMap:
Implements Map interface using a hash table.
Provides O(1) average-time complexity for get and put operations.
Does not guarantee the order of elements.
Allows null keys and values.
Not synchronized (not thread-safe), but can be synchronized externally using Collections.synchronizedMap().

TreeMap:
Implements NavigableMap interface using a Red-Black tree.
Maintains elements in ascending order based on keys (natural ordering or custom comparator).
Provides O(log n) time complexity for get, put, and remove operations.
Does not allow null keys (throws NullPointerException) but allows null values.
Not synchronized, but can be synchronized externally.

LinkedHashMap:
Extends HashMap and maintains a doubly linked list of entries in addition to the hash table.
Preserves insertion order of elements, making it suitable for applications requiring iteration order.
Provides O(1) time complexity for get, put, and remove operations assuming the hash function disperses elements properly.
Allows null keys and values.
Not synchronized, but can be synchronized externally.

Hashtable:
Similar to HashMap but is synchronized (thread-safe).
Provides legacy support and is part of the original Java Collections Framework.
Does not allow null keys or values (throws NullPointerException).
Generally slower than HashMap due to synchronization overhead.
Considered obsolete in favor of ConcurrentHashMap for concurrent applications.

ConcurrentHashMap:
Implements ConcurrentMap interface and is designed for high-concurrency environments.
Uses multiple internal segments to allow multiple threads to access the map concurrently.
Provides better scalability than Hashtable for concurrent operations.
Does not allow null keys or values (throws NullPointerException).
Supports atomic operations like putIfAbsent, replace, etc.

Que.3   What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
(Answer)   The key differences between HashMap and TreeMap in Java are:

Underlying Data Structure:

HashMap: Uses a hash table. It is part of the java.util package.
TreeMap: Uses a Red-Black tree. It is also part of the java.util package.

Ordering:

HashMap: Does not maintain any order. The order of the keys is not guaranteed to be constant over time.
TreeMap: Maintains a sorted order of the keys, either natural ordering (by default) or according to a specified comparator.

Performance:

HashMap: Provides constant-time performance for basic operations (get and put), assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets.
TreeMap: Provides logarithmic time performance for the basic operations (get and put) since it is based on a Red-Black tree.

Null Keys and Values:

HashMap: Allows one null key and multiple null values.
TreeMap: Does not allow null keys (throws NullPointerException). Allows multiple null values.

Iteration Order:

HashMap: The iteration order is random and does not follow any predictable sequence.
TreeMap: The iteration order follows the natural ordering of the keys or the order defined by the comparator.


Que.4  How do you check if a key exists  in a map in java?
(Answer)  In Java, you can check if a key exists in a map using the `containsKey` method. This method is available in both `HashMap` and `TreeMap` (and other implementations of the `Map` interface).

Here's an example:


import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // HashMap example
        Map<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
        hashMap.put("one", 1);
        hashMap.put("two", 2);
        hashMap.put("three", 3);

        // Check if a key exists in HashMap
        String keyToCheck = "two";
        if (hashMap.containsKey(keyToCheck)) {
            System.out.println("Key \"" + keyToCheck + "\" exists in the HashMap.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Key \"" + keyToCheck + "\" does not exist in the HashMap.");
        }

        // TreeMap example
        Map<String, Integer> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();
        treeMap.put("one", 1);
        treeMap.put("two", 2);
        treeMap.put("three", 3);

        // Check if a key exists in TreeMap
        if (treeMap.containsKey(keyToCheck)) {
            System.out.println("Key \"" + keyToCheck + "\" exists in the TreeMap.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Key \"" + keyToCheck + "\" does not exist in the TreeMap.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `containsKey` method is used to check if the key `"two"` exists in both the `HashMap` and the `TreeMap`. If the key exists, the program prints a message indicating its presence; otherwise, it indicates its absence.


Que.5   What are Generics in java?
(Answer)    Generics in Java are a feature that allows you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for a type that can be specified when the class, interface, or method is instantiated or called. Generics provide a way to create reusable and type-safe code without sacrificing performance or readability.

Key Benefits of Generics:
Type Safety: Generics allow for compile-time type checking, reducing the risk of ClassCastException at runtime. They ensure that you can only use objects of a specified type in a collection or method.

Elimination of Casts: With generics, you don't need to cast objects when retrieving them from a collection.

Code Reusability: Generics enable you to write more flexible and reusable code.


Que.6  What are the benefits of using  Generics in java?
(Answer)   Generics in Java provide several benefits that enhance code quality, readability, and maintainability. Here are the key benefits:

Type Safety:

Generics enable compile-time type checking, ensuring that the code doesn't have type mismatches. This reduces runtime errors by catching potential issues during compilation.
Elimination of Casts:

Without generics, when retrieving an object from a collection, you would need to cast it to the appropriate type. Generics eliminate the need for these casts, making the code cleaner and reducing the risk of ClassCastException.

Code Reusability:

Generics allow the creation of algorithms and data structures that work with any object type, increasing code reusability. This makes it easier to write general-purpose libraries.

Generic Algorithms:

Generics make it possible to write methods and classes that work with any type, thus enabling the creation of more flexible and generic algorithms.


Que.7   What is a  Generic class in java?
(Answer)    A generic class in Java is a class that can operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety. It allows you to define a class with a placeholder for a type (or types), which can be specified when an instance of the class is created. This means you can use the same class with different types without needing to write multiple versions of the class.

Syntax:
To define a generic class, you use angle brackets (< >) to specify the type parameter(s).

Example of a Generic Class:

// Define a generic class with a type parameter T
public class Box<T> {
    private T content;

    public void setContent(T content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public T getContent() {
        return content;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Box instance for storing Strings
        Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
        stringBox.setContent("Hello, Generics!");
        System.out.println("String content: " + stringBox.getContent());

        // Create a Box instance for storing Integers
        Box<Integer> integerBox = new Box<>();
        integerBox.setContent(123);
        System.out.println("Integer content: " + integerBox.getContent());
    }
}


Que.8  What is a Type parameter in java Generics?
(Answer)   A type parameter in Java generics is a placeholder for a specific type that can be specified when a generic class, interface, or method is instantiated or invoked. It allows you to define classes, interfaces, and methods that can operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety.

Defining Type Parameters
Type parameters are declared within angle brackets (< >) and can be used wherever you would normally use a type within the class, interface, or method. Commonly used type parameters include:

T for type
E for element
K for key
V for value

Que.9   What is a Generic method in java?
(Answer)   A generic method in Java is a method that is declared with type parameters, which allows the method to operate on objects of various types while maintaining compile-time type safety. These type parameters are specified in angle brackets (< >) before the method's return type.

Key Points:
1. Type Parameters: Generic methods have their own type parameters, independent of any generic type parameters declared in the class.
2. Flexibility: Generic methods can be defined in both generic and non-generic classes.
3.  Compile-Time Type Safety: Ensures that the method can only be called with arguments of the specified type.


Que.10   What is the difference between ArrayList and ArrayList<T>?
(Answer)   The difference between ArrayList and ArrayList<T> in Java is related to the use of generics and type safety.

ArrayList (Raw Type):

Definition: ArrayList without type parameters is referred to as a raw type.

Type Safety: Using raw types does not provide compile-time type safety. You can add any type of object to the list, which can lead to ClassCastException at runtime when you try to retrieve elements and cast them to a specific type.

Usage: The raw type was commonly used before Java 5, when generics were introduced.

ArrayList<T> (Generic Type):

Definition: ArrayList<T> uses generics, where T is a type parameter. It enforces type safety at compile-time.

Type Safety: When you specify the type parameter, the compiler ensures that only objects of that specified type can be added to the list. This prevents ClassCastException at runtime and eliminates the need for explicit casting when retrieving elements.

Usage: Generics were introduced in Java 5 to provide type safety and to improve code readability and reliability.
