Que. 1   What is Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming language?
(Answer) Programming languages can be classified into two categories:

1. Statically typed languages
2. Dynamically typed languages

1. Statically typed languages: Statically typed languages are the languages like C, C++, Java, etc, In this type of language the data type of a variable is known at the compile time which means the programmer has to specify the data type of a variable at the time of its declaration. We have to pre-define the return type of function as well as the type of variable it is taking or accepting for further evaluations. 

2. Dynamically typed languages: These are the languages that do not require any pre-defined data type for any variable as it is interpreted at runtime by the machine itself. In these languages, interpreters assign the data type to a variable at runtime depending on its value. We don’t even need to specify the type of variable that a function is returning or accepting in these languages. JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc are examples of dynamically typed languages.

Que. 2   What is the variable in java?
(Answer)   Variables are the name of memory location where we store data. 

Que. 3  How to assign a value to variable?
(Answer)   If we assign a value to a variable of the string type, we need to put it in double quotes: If we assign a value to a variable of the char type, we need to put it in single quotes: If we assign a value to a variable of the float type, we need to add the letter "f": "Initialization" means “to assign an initial value to a variable.”

example-  int age=15;
                   char ch='a';
                   String name="sameer hussain";
                  float num=10.5;

Que. 4   What are the primitive data types in java?
(Answer)   These are the primitive data types in java :-  int,char,double,float,boolean byte, long ,short.

Que. 5   What are the identifiers in java?
(Answer)   Identifiers can be defined as , it is the name of packages, class ,interface , variables and methods.

Que. 6   List the operators in java?
(Answer)   These are the list of operators in java:-
                     Arithmetic operators
                     Assignment operators
                     Comparison operators
                     Logical operators
                      Bitwise operators

Que. 7   explain about increment and decrement operators and give an examples.
(Answer)   increment and decrement operators :
Increment and decrement operators are unary operators. We can only apply these operators on a single operand, hence these operators are called as unary operators.

1. Increment operator (++):
the increment operator is an operator which is used to increase the value of a variable by 1, on which it is applied.

Again these increment operators are two types:

a. Pre increment (++x)
b. Post increment (x++)

a. Pre Increment Operator:
If an Increment operator is used in front of an operand, then it is called  as Pre Increment operator.

Syntax:

++x : which increments the value by 1 of ‘x’ variable.
Example:

class PreIncrement {
       
    public static void main(String[] args) {       
        int x = 10;       
        int y = ++x;       
        System.out.println("y value is: " + y);   
    }

}
Output:y value is: 11

b. Post Increment Operator:
If an Increment operator is used after an operand, then is called Post Increment operator.

Syntax:

x++ : which increase the value by 1 of variable ‘x’.
Example:

class PostIncrement {

    public static void main(String[] args) {       
        int x = 10;       
        int y = x++;       
        System.out.println("y value is: " + y);   
    }

}
Output:

y value is: 10





2. Decrement Operator (- -):
The Decrement operator is an operator which is used to decrease the value of the variable by 1, on which it is applied.

Like increment operators, decrement operators are also 2 types,

a. Pre decrement (- -x)
b. Post decrement (x- -)

a. Pre Decrement Operator:
If a decrement operator is used in front of an operand, then it is called Pre decrement operator.

Syntax:

–x : which decrease the value by 1 of variable ‘x’ .
Example:

class PreDecrement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y = --x;
        System.out.println("y value is: " + y);
    }
}
Output:

y value is: 9

Pre decrement operator is applied on ‘x’, first, the value of ‘x’ will be decremented by 1 and then the decremented value will be assigned to the variable ‘y’.

As per example, the initial value of ‘x’ is 10. After applying pre decrement operator on ‘x’, the value of ‘x’ is decremented by 1 (i.e., 9) and that value is assigned to the variable ‘y’. So, when we display the variable ‘y’ it is showing as 9.

b. Post Decrement Operator:
If a decrement operator is used after an operand, then it is called Post decrement operator.

x- – : which decrease the value by 1 of variable ‘x’ .
Example:

class PostDecrement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y = x--;
        System.out.println("y value is: " + y);
    }
}
Output:

y value is: 10
